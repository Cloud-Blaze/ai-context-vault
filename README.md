## üîß GitHub Sync Setup

## üîß Profile Manager (New)

AI Context Vault now supports persistent identity profiles that define how the AI should behave during your chats ‚Äî across any LLM interface.

### üß† What It Does

- Create role-based profiles (e.g. Developer, Business, or Custom)
- Each profile includes:
  - Alias name
  - Summary (overview of your goals)
  - CSV of selected technologies or business rules
- Only one profile can be active at a time
- Active profile auto-injects at the top of every prompt for consistent results

### üõ† Example Use Cases

- **Developer Mode**: Use a profile that says you're working in React and TypeScript with strict standards.
- **Business Mode**: Define your tone (e.g. "Formal"), SEO goals, or sales targets.
- **Custom Modes**: Invent your own ‚Äî from roleplay to project personas.

### üìÅ Stored Locally, Synced Securely

- Profiles are saved locally in `chrome.storage.local`
- Automatically synced to GitHub Gist if you‚Äôve connected a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Encryption handled using Cloudflare‚Äôs WebCrypto API (see ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù section)

### ‚ú® Access and Edit Anytime

- From the floating overlay (CMD+J / CTRL+J), go to the new **Profiles** tab
- Or from the **Options Page**, edit aliases, summaries, and attributes visually
- Profiles use the same UI style and edit patterns as bookmarks/context

> AI Context Vault gives your chats a persistent identity layer ‚Äî across models and sessions. Use it to make every prompt smarter, faster, and more ‚Äúyou.‚Äù

1. **Create a GitHub Gist**

   - Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
   - Create a new _secret_ gist (it can be empty)
   - Copy the Gist URL

2. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

   - Visit [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Create a Fine-grained token with `gist` permissions
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again)
   - Your PAT is automatically encrypted using Cloudflare's WebCrypto API before being stored
   - The encryption key is securely stored in Cloudflare Workers and never leaves their infrastructure
   - Your PAT is only decrypted when needed for GitHub Gist operations

3. **Paste into Extension Settings**
   - Open the extension's Options page
   - Paste your Gist URL and PAT
   - Data will auto-sync from now on every time context or bookmarks change
   - Your PAT remains encrypted at rest and is only decrypted when needed for GitHub operations

### üî∏ **Context Injection (Send Override)**

- Use `ALT+ENTER` to prepend context to your message without sending
- Use `ALT+SHIFT+ENTER` to inject context and send immediately
- Use `CTRL or CMD +I` Add any message in existing prompts to your chat database (synced across github gists for multiple chrome browser/computer support)
- Use `CTRL or CMD +J` Toggle the CRUD management tool for the chat you are on.
- Context is automatically formatted with:
  - Initial summary (if exists) followed by a newline
  - All active memory entries as bulleted lists, then two newlines
  - Finally, user's actual typed prompt

### üî∏ **Context Transfer**

- Export/import JSON of context entries (for migration or sharing).
