# 🚀 **AI Context Vault (Chrome Extension)**

> _A browser extension to easily manage, store, and inject custom context into AI chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek Web, etc.). Built for productivity, clarity, and never repeating yourself._

## 🤯 Why AI Always Forgets (and Why Context Vault Had to Exist)

Most people don’t realize it, but every time you start a new message in ChatGPT or any LLM...

> You are speaking to **amnesia.**

Even if the UI shows a long scroll of previous chats, the model itself only sees a **partial window of memory** — a recent slice called the **context window** (measured in tokens).

### 🔬 The Hidden Limit: Token Windows

Large Language Models don’t have infinite memory. They operate on **tokens**, and every interaction you have is tokenized like this:

- Your current message → tokens
- The last few replies → tokens
- System messages and prompts → tokens
- The model's own response → more tokens

A model like GPT-4-turbo might support 128,000 tokens (~300 pages of text). That seems huge... until you realize how fast it fills up.

Once that window is full, the oldest messages are dropped.

Not by you.

By **necessity.**

### 🧠 The Myth of Memory

Chat UIs show you every past exchange. But LLMs don’t “remember” them. They don’t “know” what you said 2 weeks ago — unless:

- It’s reloaded into context
- You manually re-injected it
- You’re paying for pro features with special memory layers

But even then, OpenAI can delete messages. Claude doesn’t remember old threads. DeepSeek, Gemini, Perplexity — all of them are **stateless** by default.

The only memory they have is the one **you control**.

---

### 🛡️ Enter: AI Context Vault

**AI Context Vault** was born from this need:

> To reclaim the timeline. To preserve your mind dumps.  
> To remember what the machine was never built to hold.

Every time you highlight, bookmark, or annotate a key idea, you’re **outsmarting the amnesia**.

Every time you inject context, you’re **restoring narrative power.**

## 🔧 GitHub Sync Setup

> GitHub Gist sync allows you to back up and restore your data across Chrome profiles, browsers, or machines.

## 🔧 Profile Manager (New)

AI Context Vault now supports persistent identity profiles that define how the AI should behave during your chats — across any LLM interface.

### 🧠 What It Does

- Create role-based profiles (e.g. Developer, Business, or Custom)
- Each profile includes:
  - Alias name
  - Summary (overview of your goals)
  - CSV of selected technologies or business rules
- Only one profile can be active at a time
- Active profile auto-injects at the top of every prompt for consistent results

### 🛠 Example Use Cases

- **Developer Mode**: Use a profile that says you're working in React and TypeScript with strict standards.
- **Business Mode**: Define your tone (e.g. "Formal"), SEO goals, or sales targets.
- **Custom Modes**: Invent your own — from roleplay to project personas.

### 📁 Stored Locally, Synced Securely

- Profiles are saved locally in `chrome.storage.local`
- Automatically synced to GitHub Gist if you’ve connected a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Encryption handled using Cloudflare’s WebCrypto API (see “Security” section)

### ✨ Access and Edit Anytime

- From the floating overlay (CMD+J / CTRL+J), go to the new **Profiles** tab
- Or from the **Options Page**, edit aliases, summaries, and attributes visually
- Profiles use the same UI style and edit patterns as bookmarks/context

> AI Context Vault gives your chats a persistent identity layer — across models and sessions. Use it to make every prompt smarter, faster, and more “you.”

1. **Create a GitHub Gist**

   - Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
   - Create a new _secret_ gist (it can be empty)
   - Copy the Gist URL

2. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

   - Visit [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Create a Fine-grained token with `gist` permissions
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again)
   - Your PAT is automatically encrypted using Cloudflare's WebCrypto API before being stored
   - The encryption key is securely stored in Cloudflare Workers and never leaves their infrastructure
   - Your PAT is only decrypted when needed for GitHub Gist operations

3. **Paste into Extension Settings**
   - Open the extension's Options page
   - Paste your Gist URL and PAT
   - Data will auto-sync from now on every time context or bookmarks change
   - Your PAT remains encrypted at rest and is only decrypted when needed for GitHub operations

### 🔸 **Context Injection (Send Override)**

- Use `ALT+ENTER` to prepend context to your message without sending
- Use `ALT+SHIFT+ENTER` to inject context and send immediately
- Use `CTRL or CMD +I` Add any message in existing prompts to your chat database (synced across github gists for multiple chrome browser/computer support)
- Use `CTRL or CMD +J` Toggle the CRUD management tool for the chat you are on.
- Context is automatically formatted with:
  - Initial summary (if exists) followed by a newline
  - All active memory entries as bulleted lists, then two newlines
  - Finally, user's actual typed prompt

### 🔸 **Context Transfer**

- Export/import JSON of context entries (for migration or sharing).

## 👁‍🗨 Introducing GOD MODE

When enabled, **GOD MODE** listens in silence.

It captures:

- Every message you type
- Every reply the AI sends
- All of it, formatted in JSON
- Saved to your GitHub Gist permanently

This is your **black box** recorder. Your archive. Your proof.  
If OpenAI deletes a chat, or Claude wipes your thread, or your browser crashes...

> You still have **everything**.
