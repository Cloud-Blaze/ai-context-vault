## Mission & Vision: Empower Your Mind, Safeguard Your Narrative

**Our Vision:**  
To reclaim and protect your narrative in a world where AI has limited memory. AI Context Vault is designed not only to preserve your critical ideas but also to act as a digital safety net—prompting supportive intervention when emotional challenges arise.

**Our Mission:**

- **Real-Time Support & Safety:**  
  When heightened emotional states or triggers are detected, our tool will gently pause posting on AI interfaces until you have time to regain balance.
- **Supportive Connections:**  
  In moments of overwhelming stress, the extension can automatically alert a pre-designated support contact—be it a friend, family member, or mental health professional.
- **Preserve and Empower Your Memory:**  
  Every thought, insight, or idea is safely saved. This isn’t just about data—it’s about safeguarding your most precious narratives.
- **Own Your Digital Experience:**  
  With integrated human support and secure storage, your digital interactions become a part of your growth and healing, ensuring that every contribution to your work is intentional and considered.

## 🤯 Why AI Always Forgets (and Why Context Vault Had to Exist)

Every time you start a new message with ChatGPT or any LLM, you’re facing **digital amnesia.**

Even if the interface displays a long history of chats, the model only sees a **partial window of memory**—the context window measured in tokens.  
Once that window fills up, the oldest messages disappear—not by your choice, but by **necessity.**

### 🔬 Token Windows & The Illusion of Memory

- **Token Windows:**  
  Every interaction is tokenized. Your current message, recent responses, and system prompts all take up tokens. Even models with vast capacities (like GPT-4-turbo’s 128,000 tokens) fill up quickly.
- **Memory’s Limits:**  
  When that token window is full, older messages are automatically dropped, regardless of their importance to your narrative.

---

## 🧠 The Myth of Memory

Chat UIs may display your entire history, but LLMs don’t “remember” them unless you re-inject the context manually. Services like Claude or DeepSeek remain **stateless by default**—the only true memory is the one you maintain.

## 🛡️ Introducing AI Context Vault

AI Context Vault was created to help you:

> **Reclaim Your Timeline. Preserve Your Insights.**  
> Save what the machine was never designed to hold.
