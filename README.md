## ü§Ø Why AI Always Forgets (and Why Context Vault Had to Exist)

Every time you start a new message with ChatGPT or any LLM, you‚Äôre facing **digital amnesia.**

Even if the interface displays a long history of chats, the model only sees a **partial window of memory**‚Äîthe context window measured in tokens.  
Once that window of memory fills up, the oldest messages disappear‚Äînot by your choice, but by **necessity.**  Go ahead and test it.  On a long thread there are deleted messages in chatgpt and more.

### üî¨ Token Windows & The Illusion of Memory

- **Token Windows:**  
  Every interaction is tokenized. Your current message, recent responses, and system prompts all take up tokens. Even models with vast capacities (like GPT-4-turbo‚Äôs 128,000 tokens) fill up quickly.
- **Memory‚Äôs Limits:**  
  When that token window is full, older messages are automatically dropped, regardless of their importance to your narrative.

## üß† The Myth of Memory

Chat UIs may display your entire history, but LLMs don‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù them unless you re-inject the context manually. Services like Claude or DeepSeek remain **stateless by default**‚Äîthe only true memory is the one you maintain.
