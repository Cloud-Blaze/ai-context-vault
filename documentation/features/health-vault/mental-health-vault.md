# Mental Health Vault: Detailed Feature Design

> _A dedicated safety feature within AI Context Vault designed to shield users from harmful digital impulses and connect them to supportive resources during emotional moments._

---

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**  
The Mental Health Vault aims to:

- Detect and monitor emotional triggers in real-time during AI interactions.
- Prevent potentially harmful or impulsive posts by pausing digital actions.
- Automatically connect the user with trusted support contacts when a crisis is detected.
- Securely log high-risk interactions for diagnostics and continuous improvement.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously analyze inputs and outputs for signs of distress.
- **Safe Intervention:** Stop or delay posts when risk exceeds safe levels.
- **Support Activation:** Alert pre-configured contacts immediately in moments of crisis.
- **Data Preservation:** Log events securely for review, providing feedback to adjust thresholds over time.

## 2. System Architecture

The Mental Health Vault is composed of several integrated modules:

### 2.1 Trigger Detection Module

- **Function:**  
  Monitors user inputs and AI outputs to evaluate sentiment and detect distress.
- **Components:**
  - **Sentiment Analyzer:** Uses NLP to gauge the emotional tone.
  - **Pattern Matcher:** Identifies key phrases that indicate heightened distress.
  - **Context Analyzer:** Assesses recent conversation history to detect abrupt emotional changes.
- **Output:**  
  A dynamic risk score triggering the safety protocol if it exceeds a set threshold.

### 2.2 Safety Interception Layer

- **Function:**  
  Intervenes when the risk score indicates unsafe levels:
  - **Post Blocking:** Temporarily blocks submission of posts identified as high-risk.
  - **UI Overlay:** Displays supportive messages and reminders (e.g., “Please pause, take a deep breath, and consider reaching out for support”).
- **User Options:**  
  Provide choices to delay, cancel, or trigger support notifications.

### 2.3 Support Connection Module

- **Function:**  
  On detecting critical levels of emotional distress:
  - **Alert Dispatch:** Automatically notifies pre-configured emergency contacts (friends, family, or mental health professionals).
  - **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Integrates with SMS, email, or in-app push alerts.
- **Configuration:**  
  Users can pre-set trusted contact details and customize the emergency message templates.

### 2.4 Secure Logging & Data Storage

- **Function:**  
  Securely logs all trigger events, user responses, and intervention actions.
- **Features:**
  - **Local Encryption:** Encrypts logs locally before storage.
  - **Optional Cloud Sync:** Integrates with GitHub Gist (or similar) for encrypted backups.
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides feedback to refine trigger thresholds and intervention protocols.

### 2.5 Configuration & Customization UI

- **Function:**  
  Empowers users to tailor Mental Health Vault according to their needs.
- **Options Include:**
  - **Trigger Sensitivity:** Adjust the threshold for intervention.
  - **Contact Management:** Add, remove, and prioritize support contacts.
  - **Custom Alert Messaging:** Edit on-screen intervention messages.
  - **Log Review:** Browse historical intervention events for personal insights.

## 3. Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Real-Time Monitoring

- As the user interacts with the AI, the **Trigger Detection Module** processes the text in real time, performing sentiment analysis and pattern matching to produce a risk score.

### Step 2: Intervention Decision

- **Low Risk:**  
  If the risk score is within safe limits, the AI interaction proceeds as normal.
- **High Risk:**  
  If the risk score exceeds the preset threshold:
  - The **Safety Interception Layer** activates.
  - The user’s post is paused, and a calming overlay is displayed.
  - Options for immediate support or self-coping reminders are offered.

### Step 3: Support Activation

- Upon user selection (or automatically if configured), the **Support Connection Module** sends an alert to designated contacts.
- The user is informed that a trusted support contact has been notified, providing immediate assistance.

### Step 4: Logging & Feedback

- Every intervention, including trigger scores, user decisions, and support actions, is securely logged.
- Users can later review these logs to understand patterns and adjust settings for future interactions.

## 4. Technology & Tools

- **NLP Libraries:**  
  Implement libraries such as spaCy or TensorFlow to perform sentiment analysis.
- **DOM Monitoring:**  
  Use MutationObservers to detect changes in text input areas and chat responses.

- **WebCrypto API:**  
  Encrypt logs and sensitive configuration data locally before storage or cloud sync.
- **API Integration:**  
  Utilize services like Twilio or SendGrid for multi-channel support alerts.

- **Cloud Sync (Optional):**  
  Enable secure sync with GitHub Gist while ensuring all data remains encrypted.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- **Adaptive Thresholds:**  
  Implement machine learning to adjust sensitivity based on historical user behavior.
- **Expanded Notification Options:**  
  Integration with additional messaging platforms and crisis support apps.
- **User Feedback Interface:**  
  Allow users to provide feedback on interventions to further tailor their settings.
- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Extend NLP capabilities to analyze multiple languages.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:**  
  Improve the overlay with customizable themes, calming animations, or integrated mindfulness exercises.
