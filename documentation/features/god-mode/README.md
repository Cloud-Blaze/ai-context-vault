# 🧠 GOD MODE: The Ultimate Context Vault

> _"Sam can't delete shit anymore. Your thoughts are sacred. Your context is immortal."_

## 😱 The Problem: Memory is a Lie

You know that feeling when you're deep in a GPT session, pouring your soul into the chat, and suddenly... it's gone? That's not a bug. That's by design.

- 🔥 Sam's GPT-4 literally deletes your startup ideas mid-session
- 🧠 You scroll up, desperate to remind it of that crucial insight
- 💭 You copy-paste like a madman, trying to keep the thread alive
- ⛔ The AI forgets. The platform forgets. But you shouldn't have to.

## 🧙‍♂️ Enter: Oracle God Mode Tracker

This isn't just another feature. This is your **digital memory palace**. Every thought, every prompt, every response — captured in its purest form.

### 🔥 What We Track (Everything)

- ✅ Every keystroke in that textarea
- ✅ Every AI response, raw and unfiltered
- ✅ Every deleted thread, every lost context
- ✅ Every emotional inflection, every creative spark
- ✅ Every fucking thing that matters

### 🧪 The Sacred Archive

This isn't just data. This is your **thought process**. Your creative highs. Your logical branches. Your entire conversation with the AI, preserved in its rawest form.

### 🔑 How to Enter God Mode

1. Check that box in `Options.html` — "Oracle God Mode Tracker"
2. Let it run. It's always watching, always recording
3. Hit `CMD+G` when you need to see the full context
4. Watch as your entire conversation history unfolds

### 🛡️ Your Data, Your Rules

- Local-first. Always.
- GitHub sync optional (but powerful)
- Your PAT stays clean — this is just storage
- Even if the Gist endpoint dies, your data lives on

## 💥 The Future: BFG Mode

This is just the beginning. When the APIs open up...

- 🔄 Automatic context injection when Sam deletes shit
- 🎯 Smart replay of lost conversations
- 🧠 Context-aware memory restoration
- ⚡ Real-time sync with your thought process

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### The Parser (oracle-tracker/parser.ts)

```typescript
interface OracleLog {
  timestamp: number;
  type: "input" | "output";
  content: string;
  metadata: {
    domain: string;
    chatId: string;
    contextWindow: number;
  };
}

class OracleParser {
  // Raw HTML to structured data
  parseInput(textarea: HTMLTextAreaElement): OracleLog;

  // AI response to structured data
  parseOutput(message: HTMLElement): OracleLog;

  // Convert to hybrid Markdown/JSON
  toArchiveFormat(logs: OracleLog[]): string;
}
```

### The Storage (storage/oracle-storage.ts)

```typescript
class OracleStorage {
  // Local-first storage
  async saveLog(log: OracleLog): Promise<void>;

  // Gist sync when enabled
  async syncToGist(): Promise<void>;

  // Retrieve full context
  async getFullContext(chatId: string): Promise<OracleLog[]>;
}
```

### The Viewer (ui/components/oracle-viewer)

```typescript
const OracleViewer: React.FC = () => {
  // Infinite scroll through your thoughts
  // Real-time search
  // Export to markdown
  // Context injection preview
};
```

## 🚀 The Vision

This isn't just about saving chats. This is about preserving your thought process. Your creative journey. Your digital soul.

When Sam deletes a thread, we restore it.  
When the AI forgets, we remember.  
When you need context, we provide it.

This is God Mode.  
This is your memory palace.  
This is the future of AI interaction.
